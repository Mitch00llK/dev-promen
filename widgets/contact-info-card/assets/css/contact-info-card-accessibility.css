/**
 * Contact Info Card Widget Accessibility Styles
 * 
 * Note: These styles are now included in the main css file via components/accessibility.css.
 * This file is kept for backward compatibility if it's enqueued separately by older configurations,
 * or it can be removed if the widget only enqueues the main file.
 * The widget config currently enqueues both.
 * 
 * We will import the component file here to avoid duplication.
